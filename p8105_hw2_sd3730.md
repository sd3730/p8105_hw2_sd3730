# Question 1

This code is used to set up the RMarkdown file and load necessary
packages.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
```

This code is to read and clean the data, keep variables, and convert the
entry variable from character to logical variable.

``` r
transit_data = read.csv("./NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv", 
                          na = c("NA", ".","")) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, starts_with("route"), entry,
         vending, entrance_type, ada) |>
    mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE)) 
```

### Dataset Description

The NYC Transit dataset contains details about the stations, including
station name and location, routes served by the stations, entrance and
exits for each subway station in New York City. The dataset also
contains information about vending machines in the station and ADA.

The data cleaning steps involved reading the CSV file, cleaning the
column names using janitor, selecting relevant columns, and converting
the entry variable from character values (“YES”/“NO”) to a logical
variable (TRUE/FALSE). The resulting dataset has dimensions of 1868 rows
and 19 columns. The dataset is considered tidy as each variable forms a
column, each observation forms a row, and each type of observational
unit is a table.

``` r
distinct_stations_count = transit_data |>
  distinct (station_name, line) |>
  nrow()
distinct_stations_count
```
