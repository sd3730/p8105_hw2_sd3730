# Question 1

This code is used to set up the RMarkdown file and load necessary packages.
```{r setup, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
```

This code is to read and clean the data, keep variables, and convert the entry variable from character to logical variable.
```{r cleanup, message = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
transit_data = read.csv("./NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv", 
                          na = c("NA", ".","")) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, starts_with("route"), entry,
         vending, entrance_type, ada) |>
    mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE)) 
```
