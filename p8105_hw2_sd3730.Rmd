# Question 1

This code is used to set up the RMarkdown file and load necessary packages.
```{r setup, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
```

This code is to read and clean the data.
```{r cleanup, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
transit_data = read.csv("./NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv", 
                          na = c("NA", ".",""))
  janitor::clean_names(transit_data)
```
